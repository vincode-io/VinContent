### HTML Main content extractor for Swift

Main content extraction is the process of extracting relavant text from an HTML page.  Relavant text is the
text that a typical person is interested in reading.  In most cases this is an article.  What isn't relavant,
advertisements and other junk, is discarded.

A common usage of main content extraction is Safari's Reader functionality.  Other implementations of this are
[Goose](https://github.com/GravityLabs/goose), [Dragnet](https://github.com/dragnet-org/dragnet), [Newspaper](https://github.com/codelucas/newspaper), and many more.
